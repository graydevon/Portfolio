This is a portfolio I made to show myself and show off some of the projects I completly over the time of my coding journey. In hopes this helps lend me a job in the future. 


I was given a list of acceptance criteria that i needed to follow while doing this portfolio. these included ...

"GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport"

Following these criterias helped create my portfolio I have for you to view. Which in all did show a bio about myself, some of my work/projects, how to contact me, and my current resume to view.
